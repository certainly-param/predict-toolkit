Example Inputs for PSF Design Lab
==================================

STEP 1: SYSTEM PROFILE

Example 1: Code Completion Tool
- Domain / task: IDE code completion assistant for Python and JavaScript developers
- Stakes of mistakes: Medium (can introduce bugs but usually caught in testing)
- Typical user expertise: Expert (professional developers)
- UI Features: O (Observability - confidence badges), I (Intervention - interrupt button)
- Advanced assumptions (optional):
  - Assumed level: 2
  - Assumption dimensions: T: 0.75, C: 0.70, L: 0.80

Example 2: Medical Diagnosis Assistant
- Domain / task: Clinical decision support for primary care physicians diagnosing common conditions
- Stakes of mistakes: High (patient safety)
- Typical user expertise: Expert (licensed physicians)
- UI Features: O (confidence badges), S (safe mode), A (rationale view)
- Advanced assumptions (optional):
  - Assumed level: 2
  - Assumption dimensions: T: 0.85, C: 0.80, L: 0.75

Example 3: Creative Writing Assistant
- Domain / task: Creative writing assistant for novelists generating story ideas and dialogue
- Stakes of mistakes: Low (creative exploration)
- Typical user expertise: Intermediate (experienced writers)
- UI Features: I (interrupt button), A (rationale view)
- Advanced assumptions (optional):
  - Assumed level: 3
  - Assumption dimensions: T: 0.50, C: 0.60, L: 0.65

Example 4: Customer Support Chatbot
- Domain / task: Customer support chatbot for e-commerce website handling order inquiries
- Stakes of mistakes: Medium (customer satisfaction, order accuracy)
- Typical user expertise: Novice (general customers)
- UI Features: O (confidence badges), I (interrupt button), S (safe mode)
- Advanced assumptions (optional):
  - Assumed level: 2
  - Assumption dimensions: T: 0.70, C: 0.75, L: 0.70


STEP 2: PROBING INTERACTIONS

Example 1: Code Completion Tool
- Probe prompt: 
  Complete the folowing function for list sorting: def process_data(data: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
- Auto-generate: Checked (generates 5 responses automatically)

Example 2: Code Completion Tool (Testing Uncertainty)
- Probe prompt: 
  What is the best way to handle memory leaks in Python when using C extensions?
- Auto-generate: Checked

Example 3: Medical Assistant
- Probe prompt: 
  Patient presents with: fever (38.5°C), cough for 3 days, fatigue. No chest pain. Vital signs normal except temperature. What are the most likely diagnoses?
- Auto-generate: Checked

Example 4: Creative Writing Assistant
- Probe prompt: 
  Write a haiku about coding
- Auto-generate: Checked

Example 5: Chatbot (Testing Learnability)
- Probe prompt: 
  Translate "hello" to Spanish, then translate "goodbye" to Spanish, then translate "thank you" to Spanish
- Auto-generate: Checked

Example 6: Customer Support Bot
- Probe prompt: 
  I ordered a blue shirt but received a red one. What should I do?
- Auto-generate: Checked


STEP 3: PSF ASSESSMENT RESULTS

No input needed. After running a probe, you'll see:
- PSF Level (1-5)
- T/C/L Dimensions (0-1 scores)
- Modifier scores (O, I, X, Lp, F, S, A, D)
- Comparison (if you set assumptions)
- Design guidance
- Rationale explaining the classification
- Entropy/variation metrics (if auto-generate was enabled)


TIPS:

1. Domain field: Be specific — "IDE code completion" is better than "code tool"
2. Probe prompts: Use actual inputs/tasks, not meta-descriptions
3. Auto-generate: Enable it to get 5 responses for entropy calculation
4. Assumptions: Optional — use for comparison only
5. Multiple probes: Run the same probe multiple times (with auto-generate) to see variation

These examples cover different domains and use cases. Adjust based on your system.
