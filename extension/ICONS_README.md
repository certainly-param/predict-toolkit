# Extension Icons

Place icon files in the `icons/` directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

You can create simple placeholder icons or use a design tool to create proper icons with the PSF Design Lab branding.

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images as placeholders.
